                <ul>
                  <li> cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. You typically pay only for cloud services you use, helping you lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently, and scale as your business needs change. </li>
                  <li>The biggest cloud computing services run on a worldwide network of secure datacenters, which are regularly upgraded to the latest generation of fast and efficient computing hardware. This offers several benefits over a single corporate datacenter, including reduced network latency for applications and greater economies of scale. </li>

                  <li>Regarding the future, I want to train myself as a well rounded software engineer. And by this I mean I'm aiming to gain knowledge about the whole ecosystem of things that lays around the creation of web-based software: front-end and back-end development, testing, infrastructure, cloud technologies, CI/CD, systems design and so on.</li>
                  <li>I can repair your computer, fix your internet, configure your printer, revive your phone, set up your email, build a billion-dollar app, and hack into any system. All for free. I am the IT god.
